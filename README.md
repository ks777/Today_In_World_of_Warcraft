# Today_In_World_of_Warcraft

## Summary
Program that uses a known Database(MySQL), Python, and the Flask framework to output the events(such as updates, expansion announcements, mythic race completion) that occured on the current day. Planned to be more specific and make it on the current date, taking into account the month and day, yet there were a lot of gaps where nothing occured, so i decided against it.
## Purpose
Basically a test/refresher on SQL databases for myself, as well as more knowledge/learning of the Flask framework. Included the actual database files, yet might not be enough iformation to properly run the program. Will look into this further/on a seperate environemt to double-check.

**Update:Database recreated and updated prior to current events.**

## Instructions
Assuming a Command Prompt usage and you have installed the proper packages onto your system:

-To start up this program, you will need to head to the project`s directory.

-run venv/scripts/activate in your command prompt to activate your virtual environment.

-and then run app.py in the command prompt. 

-To access the webpage, go to your internet browser and type Localhost:5000.

-Also printed it in the command prompt to double-check if the information matches the day.

-Enjoy!

**UPDATE: After a hardware wipe, this project was affected by losing most of its database. although I have the wordfile, it require additional work to transform it into a proper database.**
