# Today_In_World_of_Warcraft
Program that uses Databases (MySQL), python, and the flask framework to output the events(such as updates, expansion announcements, mythic race completion) that occured on this day (the current day). 
Basically a test/refresher on SQL databases

After running the virtual environment, running app.py should enable access to the website. Localhost:5000 is the initial destination and should output the needed information. Also printed it in the command prompt to double-check if the information matches the day.
