# Today_In_World_of_Warcraft
Program that uses a known Database(MySQL), Python, and the Flask framework to output the events(such as updates, expansion announcements, mythic race completion) that occured on the current day. Planned to be more specific and make it on the current date, taking into account the month and day, yet there were a lot of gaps where nothing occured, so i decided against it.

Basically a test/refresher on SQL databases for myself, as well as more knowledge/learning of the Flask framework. Included the actual database files, yet might not be enough iformation to properly run the program. Will look into this further/on a seperate environemt to double-check.

-----------------------------How to Run--------------------------------
After establishing the virtual environment, running app.py should enable access to the website. Localhost:5000 is the initial destination and should output the needed information. Also printed it in the command prompt to double-check if the information matches the day.
