# Today_In_World_of_Warcraft

## Summary
Program that uses a known Database(MySQL), Python, and the Flask framework to output notable events(such as patch updates, expansion announcements, mythic race completion) that occurred within the corresponding month and day of the year. Planned to be more specific and make it on the current date, taking into account the month and day, yet there were a lot of gaps where nothing occurred, so I decided against it.

## Purpose
Basically a test/refresher on SQL databases for myself, as well as more knowledge/learning of the Flask framework. Included the actual database files, yet might not be enough information to properly run the program. Will look into this further/in a separate environment to double-check.

## Instructions
Requires the MySQL Application to properly output!

Assuming a Command Prompt usage and you have installed the proper packages onto your system:

-To start up this program, you will need to head to the project's directory.

-run venv/scripts/activate in your command prompt to activate your virtual environment.

-and then run app.py in the command prompt. 

-To access the webpage, go to your internet browser and type Localhost:5000.

-Also print it in the command prompt to double-check if the information matches the day.

-Enjoy!
